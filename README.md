# Regression-on-Body-Fat-Percentage
This project aims to build a model that can predict a person’s body fat percentage. The model has been created by analyzing a random group of people based on multiple factors. This will result in a linear model that will be able to adequately predict the body fat percentage for a larger population size. The goal for this project is to be able to predict a person’s body fat percentage using a set of quantitative categories based on a person’s body. The objective is to do an in-depth analysis and find a model best suited for this, such that it can serve as a cost-effective alternative to more complicated methods of calculating body fat percentage. This study is of particular importance to us as it may be used to determine a person's general health based on their body fat percentage analysis, at a significantly lower cost while still being very effective.
